# Easter Island

The numerical exercises of Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) "The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use"

## Description

The model developed by Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) describes that a "feast and famine" pattern of a society is driven by the environmental/resource conditions. 

This repository illustrates the numerical exercises of the model in the paper using the different parameters to exhibits the results. 

These figures are used in the course "ECO439 Resource Economics" at Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in 2022.

## Shiny app

Sustained prosperity (e.g. Tahiti)

### Case 2: High carrying capacity and low growth rate

"Feast and Famine" case (e.g. Easter Island)

### Case 3: Low carrying capacity and low growth rate

People arrived but gave up because the initial resource stock is low (e.g. Nihoa).
