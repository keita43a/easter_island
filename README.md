# Easter Island

The numerical exercises of Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) "The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use"

## Description

The model developed by Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) describes that a "feast and famine" pattern of a society is driven by the environmental/resource conditions. 

This repository illustrates the numerical exercises of the model in the paper using the different parameters to exhibits the results. 

## Results

### Case 1: High carrying capacity and high growth rate

Sustained prosperity (e.g. Tahiti)

### Case 2: High carrying capacity and low growth rate

"Feast and Famine" case (e.g. Easter Island)

### Case 3: Low carrying capacity and low growth rate

People arrived but gave up (e.g. Nihoa)

## Plan

I would like to develop a Shiny app for the students to easily play with the parameter values. (For example, [Open-access fishery dynamic by Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.shinyapps.io/open-access-fishery/))
While I am planning to learn Shiny, it is welcome to your contribution.
