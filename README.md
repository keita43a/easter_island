# Easter Island

The numerical exercises of Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) "The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use"

## Description

The model developed by Brander &amp; Taylor (1998) describes that a "feast and famine" pattern of a society is driven by the environmental/resource conditions.
